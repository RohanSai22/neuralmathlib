# **Neural Math Library**

### **Overview**
The **Neural Math Library** is an advanced Python-based library for deep learning operations, designed to handle mathematical operations, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques used in building and training neural networks. It is equipped with various utilities to simplify neural network computations such as matrix operations, activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Softmax), loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy), and optimizers (Gradient Descent, Adam Optimizer).

This repository also includes a **Streamlit app** that allows users to interactively test the core operations of the library. Users can input matrices and vectors, test activation functions, evaluate loss functions, and run optimization algorithms in real-time, with immediate feedback on their inputs.

### **Installation**

To run this project locally, you'll need Python 3.7+ and some dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuralmathlibrary.git
   cd Neural-Math-Library
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run neural_math_app.py
   ```

This will launch a local server where you can access the app via your browser.

### **Usage**

Once the Streamlit app is running, you can interact with it using the following steps:

1. **Choose an Operation**:
   From the sidebar, select one of the operations:
   - **Matrix Operations**: Input matrices to perform operations such as dot product, element-wise addition/multiplication, etc.
   - **Activation Functions**: Test various activation functions like Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, and Softmax.
   - **Loss Functions**: Evaluate loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss.
   - **Optimization Algorithms**: Experiment with Gradient Descent or Adam optimizer for updating weights.

2. **Enter Data**:
   - For **Matrix Operations**, input the dimensions and matrices for operations.
   - For **Activation Functions**, input a list of values.
   - For **Loss Functions**, input true and predicted labels in matrix form.
   - For **Optimization Algorithms**, input initial weights and gradients.

3. **View Results**:
   After entering the input, the app will display the results for the selected operation.

### **Example**

Here is an example of how you can use the app:

1. **Matrix Operations**:
   - Choose "Matrix Operations" from the sidebar.
   - Input the dimensions of two matrices (e.g., 2x2).
   - The app will show the matrices, followed by the result of their dot product, element-wise addition, and multiplication.

2. **Activation Functions**:
   - Choose "Activation Functions" from the sidebar.
   - Input a list of values (e.g., `[1, -1, 0, 2]`).
   - The app will display the result of applying the selected activation function (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, or Softmax).

3. **Loss Functions**:
   - Choose "Loss Functions" from the sidebar.
   - Input true and predicted labels in matrix form (e.g., `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` for true labels, `[[0.2, 0.8], [0.6, 0.4]]` for predicted labels).
   - The app will compute the loss using the selected loss function.
